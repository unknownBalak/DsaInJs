Multiple pointer : 
     It is the most efficient way to find first pair in the sorted array whose  
      sum equal to zero or some other number.
    What does we do here we create two pointer first points to 0th index 
    and 2nd points to ((arr.length)-1)th index
    and we will keep adding both of them untill either we get result or
     we reach at certain position where both left and right are equal. 
 
 psudocode for 
    while (left<right){
              if(arr[right]+arr[left]===0){
                  return [arr[left],arr[right]]
              }else if(arr[right]+arr[left]>0){
                  right--;
              }else{
                  left++;
              }
   
    }
